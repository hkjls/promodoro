 I. Timer System
    The Timer System is a duration between what the user want focus in his work or when
    he must take a break.

    1. The stopWatch
        the stopWatch define the duration of a focus time from a choosed time (eg: 25:00)
    to 00:00
    2. focus Timer
        a. During this time, the name of the last task which haven't a status "Done" on
    the task list must appear under the stopWatch.
        b. At the end of each lap, the current task which appear under the stopWatch 
    must have the status "Done" on the task list then the user can start the break time
    3. Break Timer
        the break Timer is time during that the user can take a break


I create a button on the tasks.tsx, so i want to activate it and there are my request:
    1. Hide the block with the id "isTaskFinished"
    2. When the user start the timer and when this last finished show the button
(the block with the "isTaskFinished" id) to ask to the user is the task is finished
    3. If the user click "yes" set the current task on the task list done if not 
continue to the time break
