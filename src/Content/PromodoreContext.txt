                        Handle The Context of the Promodore

There are the contexts i want to handle :
        1. the focus time and break time
        2. the current task and the current task id
        3. the tasks (the list of the task)

Please configure the context promodoreContext in the Context dir and configure the
tasks.tsx file by using this context. So, if i resume you must configure the 
promodoreContext and update the Tasks.tsx and App.tsx for the context. 

With the settings page : There is a context we must configure too.
I want you integrate the workDuration, Short Break and Long Break value in our 
promodoreContext. So when i change the WorkDuration value, the focus time in the 
tasks.tsx must be change and when the ShortBreak value is change the break time 
changed too.
The long break value is set in the to break time when all the tasks is done, that
mean when the last task is finished, the value of the break time is equal to the
long break duration
